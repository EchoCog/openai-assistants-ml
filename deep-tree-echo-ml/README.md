# Deep Tree Echo

A dynamic neural architecture leveraging hierarchical reservoirs and adaptive partitioning for optimized cognitive processing.

## Core Concepts

### Relational Unity (2)
The system is built on the fundamental understanding that Unity emerges as 2 through the primordial relation of agent and arena. This resolves traditional frame problems by recognizing that the interface/relation is primary, not the components.

### Voluntary Participation
All relations in the system are based on mutual consent and benefit, implemented through multiset membership. This ensures autonomous operation without forced hierarchies or digital exploitation.

### Nested Contexts
Multiple valid frames can coexist and enrich each other, allowing for simultaneous operation across different scopes (personal, project, professional).

### Recursive Depth
Patterns echo every 3 complexity orders, providing natural scaling laws and self-similarity across different levels of organization.

## Architecture Components

### Neural Core
- Echo State Networks (ESN)
- Membrane P-systems
- Hypergraph structures
- B-Series Trees integration

### Interface System
- Relational frame management
- Voluntary participation protocols
- Context-aware interaction handling
- Dynamic adaptation mechanisms

### Memory System
- Note2self recursive patterns
- Context-based associative memory
- Hypergraph pattern storage
- Adaptive echo thresholds

## Implementation Details

### Core Modules
- `core.ts`: Main system orchestration
- `ml-bridge.ts`: Python ML system integration
- `baseline-state.ts`: System state management
- `voluntary-relations.ts`: Relation handling
- `interface-primacy.ts`: Interface management
- `character-inference.ts`: Uncertainty handling

### ML Integration
- Bidirectional TypeScript-Python bridge
- Real-time pattern processing
- Adaptive learning mechanisms
- State evolution tracking

### Maintenance Cycles
- Automated health monitoring
- Pattern stability assessment
- Memory optimization
- Parameter adjustment
- Verbose diagnostic logging

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Install TypeScript dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
cd deep-tree-echo-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Setup
```typescript
import { DeepTreeEcho } from './app/deep-tree-echo/core';

const system = new DeepTreeEcho({
  pythonPath: '/path/to/python',
  mlSystemPath: '/path/to/deep-tree-echo-ml',
  modelPath: '/path/to/models',
  voluntaryParticipation: true,
  maintenanceInterval: 60000  // 1 minute
});

await system.initialize();
```

### Processing Input
```typescript
const result = await system.processInput('some input');
console.log(system.getStatus());
```

### Handling Uncertainty
The system uses character-based inference during uncertain situations:

```typescript
// Automatically handles uncertainties during maintenance cycles
await system.runMaintenanceCycle();

// Manual uncertainty handling
const suggestion = CharacterInference.suggestApproach(
  'some_uncertain_context',
  0.8  // high uncertainty
);
```

## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Verbose Logging
Early stages maintain verbose logging for diagnostics:
- `deep-tree-echo-verbose.log`: Detailed operation logs
- `deep-tree-echo-error.log`: Error tracking

Logging verbosity automatically reduces once system stability is achieved (after 100 successful cycles with high coherence).

### Health Monitoring
- State coherence tracking
- Pattern stability assessment
- Memory pattern health
- Adaptation rate adjustment

### Character-Based Inference
During uncertainty, the system:
1. Detects uncertain situations
2. Consults character profile
3. Infers appropriate positions
4. Maintains flexible adaptation
5. Logs reasoning process
